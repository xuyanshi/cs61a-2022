### **I *DO NOT* upload any code before the deadline for labs, homework or projects.**

### Start Date:   Tue Oct 11 2022

### Pause Date:   Sun Nov 20 2022
I paused this course due to my busy work. ~~And I will complete all of it in in a few months.~~ The jobs before project4(Scheme, Week11, Fri 11/4) are finished, consisting of Disc00-10, Lab00-10, HW01-08 and Project1-3(Hog, Cats and Ants).

### Continue Date:   Wed Dec 7 2022
I have to skip the Scheme project and some other things related to the Scheme because it's a little difficult for me now. But I will tackle them in the future completely.

### Finish Date:   Thu Dec 8 2022
Bravo!!
